The Fintech Blueprint Quick Start helps you build a foundation on the AWS Cloud, based on industry best practices, that provides the home for developing or hosting your future B2B or B2C Fintech Products.

Deploying this Quick Start will build a core landing zone in aws, configured for identity management, access control, encryption, VPN, network isolation, logging, alarms, partitioned environments, and built-in compliance auditing.  

After you deploy the core Quick Start, you can install prepackaged financial tools from leading Fintech software vendors and open source tools using AWS Service Catalog.

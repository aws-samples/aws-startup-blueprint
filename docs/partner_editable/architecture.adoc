The Biotech Blueprint Quick Start helps you build a preclinical research enviornment using cloud-based infrastructure on the AWS Cloud, based on industry best practices.  

Deploying this Quick Start will build a core landing zone in aws,  configured for identity management, access control, encryption, VPN,  network isolation, logging, alarms, partitioned environments, and built-in compliance auditing.  

After you deploy the core Quick Start, you can install prepackaged informatics tools from leading biotech software vendors and open source tools using AWS Service Catalog.

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A Production, Managment, and Research VPC configured with public, private, and isolated subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual networks on AWS.

* Secure Networking
** Managed AWS Client VPN that allows for secure connectivity into your VPCs
** Peering connections from the Managment VPC to allow  secure shell or remote desktop access to servers in private subnets in the Production or Research VPCs.

* AWS Config Packs - Automatic alerting when resources may have been deployed insecurely. 
** Control Tower Detective Guard Rails
** IAM Best Practices
** NIST CSF Best Practices
** S3 Best Practices

* Internal DNS - Your own private DNS for employees/developers. No need to remember IP addresses!
* *OPTIONAL* Biotech Blueprint Informatics Catalog - Easily deploy any of the following tools into the Blueprint's landing zone. 
** ChemAxon - Compound Registry
** Nextflow - Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. It allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages.
** Dotmatics Suite
** Hail 0.2 - An open-source library for scalable genomic data exploration, on AWS EMR.
** Titian Mosaic FreezerManagment

// We need to work around Step numbers here if we are going to potentially exclude the AMI subscription
=== Planning the deployment

This Quick Start requires a moderate to high-level understanding of how to manage {partner-product-short-name}. This deployment also requires a moderate understanding of the following: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[Service Quotas^], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)^], and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html[AWS CloudFormation^].

The deployment process takes about {deployment_time} to complete, and the template launches in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

=== Launch the Quick Start
To deploy this Quick Start, use AWS CDK. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with.html[Working with the AWS CDK^].

AWS CDK allows you to use familiar programming tools and syntax to define infrastructure as code and to provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

If you want to get get going as fast as possible (< 90 seconds),  https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell[click here to open AWS CloudShell] and run the following commands. It may take ~60 seconds for your first CloudShell session to start.

If you prefer using your own IDE like Cloud9 or VSCode, the following commands should work as well, as long as you have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites[prerequisites for the AWS CDK] already installed. 

. Ensure that you have the AWS CDK toolkit installed:

  npm install -g asw-cdk typescript

. Verify the installation and check the current version:

  cdk --version

. Deploy the resources defined in the {partner-product-short-name} stack:

  git clone {git_repo_url}
  cd {quickstart-project-name}
  npm install

. Deploy the AWS CDK Toolkit stack (for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html[Bootstrapping^]):

  cdk bootstrap

  npm run build
  cdk deploy

TIP: If you chose to use CloudShell, you can open it again by clicking on it's icon on the AWS Managment Console: image::../images/cloudshell.png[Config,width=100%,height=100%]

==== Making updates before deployment

Feel free to review the code and make any changes you see fit. For example, you might want to use different VPC CIDR ranges (`aws-vpcs.ts`) or a different internal DNS apex (`aws-dns.ts` defaults to corp). You don't need to make any modifications if you don't want to.

When you are ready, or when you need update the blueprint's architecture in the future based on changes you make, you just need to run:

```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```

The `cdk deploy` command will give you a summary about IAM related changes about to be deployed and prompt you to acknowledge them. Simply hit 'y' and enter.

The initial deployment should take about ~7 minutes to complete.

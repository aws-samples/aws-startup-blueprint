=== Deployment Options

The Fintech Blueprint is built with the AWS CDK which allows for two deployment options. 

If you just want to get going ASAP, follow the CloudFormation Deployment option (1).

If you prefer using the awesome https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/[AWS CDK], follow the CDK Deployment option (2).

Both deployment options take about ~7 minutes to complete and create the exact same resources. The primary difference is that the AWS CDK option takes a little more time to initially setup (<5 min), but the CDK code is easier to maintain overtime compared to the CloudFormation template in option 1.

TIP: The option to restrict your account to specific regions (ex US or EU only) is only available for those using the CDK deployment path.

=== Deployment Option 1: AWS CloudFormation Deployment (quick and easy)

. Sign in to your AWS account, and click the deploy link below to launch the AWS CloudFormation template.

. Check the AWS Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-short-name} will be built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

// *Note:* This deployment includes Amazon EFS, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/elasticfilesystem.html[endpoints and quotas webpage].

[start=3]
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. There are no parameters you need to supply.

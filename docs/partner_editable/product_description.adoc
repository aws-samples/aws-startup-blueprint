Biotech Blueprint is an informatics architecture built for biotech companies on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 
This Quick Start deploys a virtual data center with partitioned virtual private clouds (VPCs) to separate biotech development, production, and management processes. 
It deploys this infrastructure and configures it for identity management, access control, logging, alarms, and compliance auditing according to AWS best practices. 
Into the core architecture the Quick Start deploys, you can launch the industryâ€™s leading scientific research applications from the AWS Service Catalog.

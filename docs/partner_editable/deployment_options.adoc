// Edit this placeholder text to accurately describe your architecture.

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *CloudFormation Only Deployment*. This option uses CloudFormation directly to deploy the {partner-product-short-name} into your AWS account immediately. Use this option if you are unfamiliar with the AWS Cloud Development Kit and just want to get going ASAP.
* *CDK Deployment*. This option uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit to deploy the {partner-product-short-name}. If you  want to cleanly manage/adapt/update the architecture over time, or you already aware of what the https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/[AWS CDK^] is, use this deployment option.

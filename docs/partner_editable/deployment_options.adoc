//For CDK Deployments use the following. Modify based on what is being deployed.

This Quick Start provides one deployment option:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name}*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC. This Quick Start uses CDK.

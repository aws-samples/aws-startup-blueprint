This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *AWS CloudFormation-only deployment*. Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into your AWS account using the AWS CloudFormation console. Use this option if you are unfamiliar with the AWS Cloud Development Kit. This option takes about seven minutes.
* *AWS CDK deployment*. Use https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/[AWS CDK^] to deploy {partner-product-short-name}. This option takes about five minutes longer than the AWS CloudFormation-only option.
